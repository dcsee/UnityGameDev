# UnityGameDev
For practicing C# game development with the Unity engine

See Assets/Menus for my C# code for opening and closing the game from the main menu.
See Assets/OpeningScene for my C# code handling voxel generation and voxel animation.
Assets/ProceduralToolkit contains library methods for creating 3D polygons. This library allows easy generation of platonic solids such as cubes, tetrahedrons, octahedrons, etc. NOTE: I did not personally write this library! I downloaded it from the Unity asset store.
